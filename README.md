Using two plugin managers:
- TPM for Tmux
- Vundle for Vim

After cloning, remember to run `tmux source ~/.tmux.conf` for Tmux plugins and to `:PluginInstall` in Vim for Vundle plugins.

A list of things to remember (will clean up later):
- Zsh theme: Bullet Train
- Maglev will max tmux compatible with Bullet Train (don't hate me, I'm a designer at heart)
- More notes to come soon...
